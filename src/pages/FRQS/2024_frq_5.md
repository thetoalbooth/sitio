#### Consider the curve defined by the equation $ ~x^2 + 3y + 2y^2 = 48$. 

#### It can be shown that $ ~\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \dfrac{-2x}{3+4y}$. 

<div class="enumerate">
(a)
There is a point on the curve near $ (2,4) $ with $ x$-coordinate $3$.
Use the line tangent to the curve at $ (2,4) $ to approximate the $y$-coordinate of this point. 

(b) Is the horizontal line $ y = 1 $ tangent to the curve? Give a reason for your answer. 

(c) The curve intersects the positive $x$-axis at the point $ \big( \sqrt{48},0 \big)$.  Is the line tangent to the curve at this point vertical? Give a reason for your answer.  

(d)
